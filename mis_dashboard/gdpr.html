                    <p>The MIS platform is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the MIS Platform and governs data collection and usage. By using the MIS website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
                    
                    <p>The MIS platform collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. The MIS platform also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your postcode, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by the MIS platform. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by the MIS platform for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the MIS platform.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through the MIS platform public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: The MIS platform does not read any of your private online communications.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The MIS platform encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from the platform so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. The MIS platform is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the MIS platform.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>
                    
                    <p>The MIS platform collects and uses your personal information to operate the MIS platform and deliver the services you have requested. The MIS platform also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from the platform and its affiliates. The MIS platform may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The MIS platform does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. The MIS platform may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, the platform may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to the platform, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The MIS platform does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The MIS platform keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within the platform, in order to determine what platform services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the MIS platform to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The MIS platform will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the platform or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the platform; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the platform, or the public.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
                    
                    <p>The MIS platform use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize any MIS pages, or register with any MIS sites or services, a cookie helps the platform to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same MIS site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the MIS features that you customized.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the MIS services or websites you visit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
                    
                    <p>The MIS platform secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. The MIS platform secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Changes to this Statement</h3>
                    
                    <p>The MIS platform will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. The MIS platform encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how the platform is protecting your information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
                    
                    <p>The MIS platform welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that the platform has not adhered to this Statement, please contact us at WebAdmin@mis.co.uk.
